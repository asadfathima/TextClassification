On the other hand, if rats keep deserting the doomed ship, at a certain point this administration will fall apart from attrition. What I see with Flynn falling on his sword is smart protection of Pence, who so far has plausible deniability of involvement, having been \"lied to\" by Flynn.

I'm out and about every day but rarely see any cyclists in the full vehicle sized lanes they are granted. They also don't need to be on a major artery where traffic is already over crowded. Pushing them a block or two over will keep them safer.

They are distinctly different.  A brown will attack and maul out of defense.  A black will attack, kill and eat you just because it wants too.  Every bear cannot be predicted in behavior and you can't exactly catagorize them all the same either, they all have different personalities the same as humans.

Assuming it is NOT true, the only thing I can conjure is that Principal Dawkins was not at the game but was told this by parents and/or coaches.  He really has no reason to make something up like this and go through the trouble of sending a letter to parents (which somebody gave to the Post). Without proof (i.e. a photograph) or even one of the Weld Central High confirming this happened I think it becomes he said-she said and the onus is on Manual High School to prove the flag was raised.

Alaska has a large population of people who live a subsistence lifestyle below poverty levels.  The dividend means much more to this population than folks living in Anchorage making say $50,000/year.  Federal and state policies have enabled and subsidized this subsistence population.  New reality option:  carve out $7 billion from Perm Fund and name it the \"Alaska Subsistence Welfare Fund\" to pay $1250/year to Alaska natives who live at poverty levels in villages.

Some other developed countries ration care directly. Some spend less on facilities, technology, or physician incomes, leading to long waits for care. Such trade-offs are not inherently bad, and not all health care is of equal value, though that would seem to be a determination most appropriately made by patients rather than the government.

The agri-chemical industry is working very hard to discredit organic farming.  Fortunately, they are not succeeding.  More and more farmers are adopting organic methods of production, the supply of certified organic produce is ever increasing and the prices are becoming more competitive with produce grown on megafarms utilizing petroleum based fertilizers and chemical herbicides and pesticides.  The pollution of water tables and riverways with, especially, nitrogen and phosperous compounds result from overapplication of petroleum based chemical fertilizers is a widespread problem.  read up a bit on these issues...."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "not toxic"}]}

The pistol is the most common firearm used to do prevent crime, too. It's highly portable and concealable (which is good for law-abiding citizens... not so good for criminals).  The question really becomes - do we prohibit law-abiding citizens from the use of pistols used tens of thousands of times per year in defense of themselves because of criminals?  \n\nMagazines are easily and quickly changed.

Movies now glorify fights in which a woman takes down legions of men in hand-to-hand combat.  On the other hand, we see these claims of wrongdoing from conveniently far enough back in time so that there is no hope whatsoever of obtaining convincing evidence to prove or disprove allegations.  When asked why the reports and allegations are delivered so long after the incidents, inevitably the women suggest that they were afraid or intimidated or might face retaliation or whatever excuse.  Men (except when molested by priests as children) cannot get away with this.  The choice of these women to attack when defense is no longer possible because time has rendered direct evidence of any kind impossible is the action of cowards.

So the proper realistic interest rate for a mortgage rate is 6, and that is where we are going to eventually get, sooner then later.  Better for the homeowner to prepare for this eventuality.  Also, the price of a home is overvalued by say 300,000 on a million dollar home, what sense does it make to loan 700,000? People don't buy houses lenders buy houses.

My article was sincere in that ultimately, having two or more strong, but sensible political parties is needed to keep a Democracy alive.  The highest form of Government, is a Representative type of system where the leaders (full of imperfect humans) are running the show in a way that We The People approve of.  Too many years of the divide becoming wider and wider - especially in the last 8 years - is why Donald Trump became elected.   Too much centralized power leads to Tyranny (i.e. failure).  That was the Legacy of Obama.  When asked who will I vote for: I always reply, start with the understanding that Liberty & Freedom is what Humans yearn for.  The farthest from that is forms of Tyranny.  Whoever will pursue polices closer to the former, gets my vote.   That is why I voted for Donald Trump.

That is double since he/she owns a Company. One can draw an income in form of dividends which is 8.1% up to 38K and 41% over 202K. Note that dividend is paid and taxed at this rate after the 15% of tax. One also needs to consider benefits before leaving  regular emplyment.\nYes, there are few benefits, writing off, mileage, company car, office space in your house, tools and so on. Dividends can be paid only to  shareholders of a company. There are some ideas floating around about what some companies may do to avoid taxes, but in bulk most of them are tax fraud and evasion.

Indeed, Yahweh directly creates everyone of us in the womb by a similar act of direct creation, of ensoulment of sexually reproduced biological matter.
